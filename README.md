 - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. DOM events are actions that occur in the browser, such as a user clicking on an element, a page finishing loading, or an element being updated.

In JavaScript, you can use DOM events to add interactivity to your web pages and create dynamic user experiences. For example, you can use the "click" event to respond when a user clicks on a button, or the "load" event to run some code when a page finishes loading.

- Here's an example of how you can use the "click" event in JavaScript:

```js
let button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  alert("Button was clicked!");
});
```
